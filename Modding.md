# QUICK GUIDE

I added extra folders for the following:
* Difficulties
* Credits
* Note Skins
* Pixel UI
* Stages
* Main Menu Assets

I also made a custom Source Code which can be found here: https://github.com/Joalor64GH/FNF-PE-Extra-Folders

To find out how these work, try the following:

* Looking at the readme.txt files
* Checking out the wiki: https://github.com/Joalor64GH/Joalor64-Engine/wiki
* Looking at the document in docs/Joalor64 Engine Guide.docx

Have fun with this lol.
